# Taints & Tolerance
- basically fixes the node to the pod, it is exactly opposite to node affinity

> Taint the node
kubectl taint no rahul-aio-control-plane size=small:NoExecute

> Add this to spec section of pod with NoSchedule effect
tolerations:
- key: "key1"
  operator: "Equal"
  value: "value1"
  effect: "NoSchedule"

> Add this to spec section of pod with NoSchedule effect matching key
tolerations:
- key: "key1"
  operator: "Exists"
  effect: "NoSchedule"

> Add this to spec section of pod with NoExecute effect
tolerations:
- key: "key1"
  operator: "Equal"
  value: "value1"
  effect: "NoExecute"
  tolerationSeconds: 3600
