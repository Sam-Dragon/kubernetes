# Multiple Containers
- we can define multiple containers within container sections

# Patterns
- sidecar 
- Here the container which share same life cyle, network space, volumes
Ex: Log Agent for container

---
spec:
  containers:
  - image: nginx
    name: nginx-label
  - image: log-agent
    name: log-agent
---

# Adapter
- adapt to the changes w.r.t environment
Ex: Adaptor service to convert dates as per the database
---
spec:
  containers:
  - image: nginx
    name: nginx-label
  - image: adapter-agent
    name: adapter-agent
---

# Ambaseddor
- provided as a seperate container for database connectivity based on ambassedor container

---
spec:
  containers:
  - image: nginx
    name: nginx-label
  - image: ambassedor-agent
    name: ambassedor-agent
---

Note: Implementation of above patterns for a pod is same
